Online Robotics Competition at-Home (ORCAH) is a student-led organization hosting unofficial scrimmages coming up to VEX Worlds 2021. Our aim is to provide world-qualified teams the experience and resources they require to excel during these unprecedented times. Through our free practice scrimmages leading up to our championship scrimmage, teams will be able to simulate and practice for Worlds, collaborate, and learn this new form of competition on a larger scale than prior events.
